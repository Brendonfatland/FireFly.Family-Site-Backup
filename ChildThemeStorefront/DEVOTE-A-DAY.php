				<p class="mainP">Instead of working here at FireFly, <span class="BlueishColor">pick a day to work for a worthy cause with a registered charity, school, hospital, or religious organization</span>. It could be volunteering, handing out food, participating in an event, or any number of things, but whatever you pick, be sure to get your manager’s approval at least two weeks in advance and notify HR of your plans. </br></br>You’ll be expected (i.e. required) to bring back several photos suitable for posting on social media. We love showing-off our employees giving back to the community! Be sure to wear your FireFly gear. Want to go big? Coordinate your plans with other FireFly employees and make an impact together. One last thing: the charity or organization you choose must be non-political, officially recognized, and a positive reflection on the values and public image of FireFly Computers. All organizations and events are subject to FireFly approval. Have fun, be creative, and get out there and do some good!</p><img src="http://www.firefly.family/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Devote-A-Day-Footers.png" alt="" width="899" height="653" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1971" />

			<p class="mainP">You've got ideas, you've got skills, and FireFly want's to help you shine. That's why we're giving you a day to put those skills and ideas to use in whatever way YOU think will benefit FireFly the most. Ever heard of Gmail? It was coded in a single day by someone at Google who was told not to do their regular job that day. Groupon? Invented as a side project by a music major interning at a tech company. Is there something at FireFly you wish you had time to invent, change, improve, explore, or try? Now's your chance to do it! </br></br><span class="BlueishColor">For one day, you can come to FireFly and get paid NOT to do your regular job</span>. Here are the rules: 1) you have to actually be at FireFly, 2) your activities can't be disruptive to other FireFly employees or activities, and 3) you need to work on something that at least has potential to improve yourself, your job, the jobs of other FireFly employees, the products and services offered by FireFly, the efficiency of FireFly's operations, or exploring a potential job change within FireFly. There's a ton of flexibility in what you want to work on, just make sure to get your manager's approval at least two weeks in advance and notify HR of your plans. Well, what are you waiting for? Go start improving!</p><p class="orange">Eligibility: Full-time FireFly Employees in good standing.</br>
